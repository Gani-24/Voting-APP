##  How I did this Project
This was my first project in Web Developement, 
Always wanted to start learning django and this was a great oppurtunity.
I devoted a significant portion of my time to working on the backend (Django) side of the project.
- To begin with, I started by creating simple HTML templates and spent a lot of time learning about Django, referring to multiple projects related to Django

- I focused on implementing features such as login forms, registration forms, retrieving data, and authenticating in Django.

- I spent the majority of my time learning how to add restrictions, such as allowing users to vote only once for a title, displaying a warning message for wrong usernames and passwords during authentication.

- Once I had completed the basic requirements, I started learning about how to connect the Firebase Realtime Database to my project.

- I spent some time working on this and managed to connect the database to receive the number of votes received, the candidate, and the title in real-time.

- Only after I had completed the backend, did I begin working on the frontend part of the project. I went through some Bootstrap tutorials and created some decent-looking web pages, using what I had learned.

## How to Run the Project
- After cloning the repo, go to the virtual env where django is installed 
and run the command
```
python3 manage.py runserver

```
and go to the server given in the terminal
**after selecting a candidate and vote is clicked one time in the voting page, wait for a few seconds for the results page to load, as it takes a few seconds for the data to be sent to firebase**

* There were other small issues for which i Googled  as well.

## Problems
- Was Not able to Host the webapp, tried many things like pythonanywhere and railway,
- So i Created a new repo (https://github.com/Gani-24/myVoting) and uploaded all the same files and removed the Firebase Functionality, and was able to host the app.
- for the firebase functionality to work, have to clone this repo and run it locally
